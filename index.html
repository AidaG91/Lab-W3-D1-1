        <p>
          Alan Schaller was born in 1988 in London, where he still lives today.
          He took up photography in 2015 as a past time, only to find his work
          published only one year later in magazines and newspapers in the UK.
          Since then his portfolio and profile have gone from strength to
          strength, and today he is regarded as one of the most renowned
          photographers of his generation. Described by Leica as "an icon of
          contemporary black and white photography" and by TeNeues publishing as
          "setting the standards in modern street photography", his work is
          known for its strong contrast and focus on shape and form, and focus
          on life in urban environments.
